# Distributed File System

The Distributed File System project is an eventually consistent distributed file system, which makes use of different techniques such as Gossiping, Consistent Hashing, Vector Clocks and Anti-Entropy.

## Introduction

The file system is implemented as a key value map of type (string, file) with the following operations:

- **get**(key) to retrieve a file from the system;
- **put**(key) to store a file in the system;
- **delete**(key) to remove a file in the system;
- **getAll**() to retrieve all the files stored in a random node;

The operations provided by the client, in addition to the one mentioned before, are:

- **list** print on screen a list of all the files present in the clientâ€™s database
- **enableLB** enable the utilization of the remote load balancer nodes
- **disableLB** disable the utilization of the remote load balancer nodes
- **help** to show the helper
- **exit** to close the service

## User Guide

All the project can be built using **gradle**. You don't need to download it, because you can use the gradle wrapper that downloads for you all the necessary tools. It automatically starts when you launch one of the subsequent commands.

**Requirements**:

- Java8
- *Vagrant and VirtualBox (optional only for a Pseudo-Distributed Environment)*

### Distributed Nodes

The LoadBalancer and StorageNode nodes can be built using the following command:
```bash
./gradlew server:build
```
and runs it with:
```bash
java -jar NodeLauncher-<version>.jar [parameters]
```

The only mandatory parameter is:

- `-t <nodeType>` to start a LoadBalancer (type = 0) or a StorageNode (type = 1) node

Optional parameters:

- `-p [--port] <value>` port used to listen the incoming requests. This option is valid only for LoadBalancer nodes
- `-a [--addr] <value>` set the ip address of the node
- `-n [--node] <arg>` add a new node, where arg is in the format `hostname:port:nodeType`
- `-r [--rloc] <path>` set the location of the resources. This option is valid only for StorageNode nodes
- `-d [--dloc] <path>` set the location of the database. This option is valid only for StorageNode nodes
- `-h [--help]` show the help informations

### Client Node

The Client can be built in this way:
```bash
./gradlew client:build
```
and runs it with:
```bash
java -jar Client-<version>.jar [parameters]
```
Optional parameters:

- `-p [--port] <value>` port used to receive the remote connection
- `-a [--addr] <value>` set the ip address of the node
- `-n [--node] <arg>` add a new node, where arg is in the format `hostname:port:nodeType`
- `-r [--rloc] <path>` set the location of the resources
- `-d [--dloc] <path>` set the location of the database
- `-locale` start the system in the local environment
- `-h [--help]` show the help informations

### Local Environment

If you want to test the system in a multi-threaded environment using your machine, you can do that launching the Client node with the `-locale` option.
If the list of input nodes is empty a fixed number of distributed nodes is used, namely 5 LoadBalancers and 2 StorageNodes.

### Pseudo-Distributed Environment

Using the `Vagrantfile` file provided in the distribution you can run the system in a pseudo-distributed environment. In the file are defined 6 virtual machines that can be used both for a remote node (LoadBalancer or StorageNode) that for a Client.
My suggestion is to assign the VMs in this way: 1 for the Client, 1 for the LoadBalancer and 4 for the StorageNodes, just to be sure that the quorum can be reached.
